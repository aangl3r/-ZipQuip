# -ZipQuip

I don’t know who lives near me. Out of the 97 houses in this neighborhood, I could tell you maybe two names of people who live here – and one of them is the HOA president.

Enter ZipQuip.

ZipQuip is an open forum for people near you. With a ZipQuip account, you can make and view posts visible by anyone in your zip code, and send and receive direct message replies.

ZipQuip uses google authentication for account creation, and passport for session storage. Your password is protected with hashing through the use of bcrypt. Once you’ve created an account, log in to view the most recent posts and the weather in your area.

You can reply to any comment by clicking the reply button. This sends a direct message to the user that made the post. You can view the 50 most recent posts with the “View More” button. Here you can also send direct messages.

By visiting your profile, you can change your name and zip code, which updates the comments and weather for the new zip. This way, you’re not out of luck if you don’t find what you’re looking for in your immediate vicinity.
